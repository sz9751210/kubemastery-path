# Advanced Pod Security

## Pod Security Standards (PSS)
Replaced PodSecurityPolicies (PSP). Defined in 3 levels:
1. **Privileged**: Unrestricted (Admin level).
2. **Baseline**: Minimally restrictive (Default).
3. **Restricted**: Heavily restricted (Best practice).

## Pod Security Admission (PSA)
The built-in admission controller to enforce PSS via Namespace labels.

\`\`\`bash
# Enforce restricted standard on 'dev' namespace
kubectl label ns dev pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce=restricted
\`\`\`

## mTLS (Mutual TLS)
Encrypting traffic *between* pods.
- Usually handled by a Service Mesh (Linkerd, Istio), but understanding the concept is key for CKS.
