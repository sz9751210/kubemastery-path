# Network Policies

The firewall for Kubernetes.

> [!WARNING]
> By default, K8s is a **Flat Network**. Any pod can talk to any pod.

## Default Deny Logic
Start by denying everything, then allow specific traffic.

# Task 1: List Policies
Verify if any NetworkPolicies exist in the cluster.

```bash
kubectl get networkpolicies -A
```

```setup
echo "Ready"
```

```verify
kubectl get networkpolicies -A > /dev/null
```
