# Runtime Security

Protecting the running process.

## Tools
- **Falco**: The runtime security engine. Uses rules to detect abnormal behavior (e.g., shell in container, modifying /etc).
- **AppArmor**: Restrict programs' capabilities with per-program profiles.
- **Seccomp**: Restrict system calls a process can make.

## Behavioral Analytics
Detecting threats based on *patterns* rather than known signatures.
- Process spawning unexpected children.
- Unexpected outbound network connections.
