# Runtime Security

Protecting the running process.

## Tools
- **Falco**: The runtime security engine. Uses rules to detect abnormal behavior (e.g., shell in container, modifying /etc).
- **AppArmor**: Restrict programs' capabilities with per-program profiles.
- **Seccomp**: Restrict system calls a process can make.

# Task 1: Check AppArmor Profiles
List the loaded AppArmor profiles on the node.

```bash
cat /sys/kernel/security/apparmor/profiles | head -n 5
```

```setup
echo "Ready"
```

```verify
ls /sys/kernel/security/apparmor/profiles > /dev/null 2>&1 || (echo "AppArmor not enabled (expected in some envs)" && exit 0)
```

## Behavioral Analytics
Detecting threats based on *patterns* rather than known signatures.
- Process spawning unexpected children.
- Unexpected outbound network connections.
