# Audit Logging & Monitoring

If you didn't log it, it didn't happen.

## Audit Logs
Records the sequence of actions taken by the cluster (API Server).
- **Stages**: RequestReceived, ResponseStarted, ResponseComplete, Panic.
- **Policy**: Defines rules for what to log and how much detail.

\`\`\`yaml
# audit-policy.yaml example
apiVersion: audit.k8s.io/v1
kind: Policy
rules:
  - level: Metadata
    resources:
    - group: ""
      resources: ["secrets"]
# Task 1: Locate Audit Policy
Find where the audit policy is typically stored or referenced (mock verification).

```bash
ls /etc/kubernetes/audit-policy.yaml 2>/dev/null || echo "Not found (expected)"
```

```setup
echo "Ready"
```

```verify
# Just getting pods is enough to prove interactivity vs the API server
kubectl get pods -A > /dev/null
```

## Monitoring (Syscall)
Using **Falco** to monitor system calls at the kernel level.
- Detects: File access, Process execution, Network activity.
