# System Hardening

Kubernetes is only as secure as the Linux nodes it runs on.

## Kernel Hardening
-   **Seccomp**: Restrict syscalls.
-   **AppArmor**: Restrict file access / capabilities.

## Container Sandboxing
For high-risk workloads, standard containers (shared kernel) might not be enough.
-   **gVisor (runsc)**: Userspace kernel, intercepts syscalls.
-   **Kata Containers**: Lightweight VMs for strong isolation.

## Reducing Attack Surface
-   Disable unused services (SSH, FTP).
-   Firewall rules (UFW/IPTables) to restrict node-to-node access outside of K8s ports.

\`\`\`bash
# Check open ports on the node
netstat -tulpn
\`\`\`
