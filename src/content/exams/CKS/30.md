# Role Based Access Control (RBAC)

**Authentication** (Who are you?) vs **Authorization** (What can you do?).

## Core Objects
1. **Role**: Rules (verbs + resources) scoped to a **Namespace**.
2. **ClusterRole**: Rules scoped linearly (Cluster-wide).
3. **RoleBinding**: Connecting a Subject (User/ServiceAccount) to a Role.
4. **ClusterRoleBinding**: Connecting a Subject to a ClusterRole.

# Task 1: Check Permissions
Verify if you can create pods.

```bash
kubectl auth can-i create pods
```

```setup
echo "Ready"
```

```verify
kubectl auth can-i create pods | grep -E "yes|no"
```
