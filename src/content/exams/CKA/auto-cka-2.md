# Auto CKA Practice (Batch 2)

This is an auto-generated exam to provide infinite practice questions.

# Task 1: Create a Pod
Create a pod named `resource-4xsofq` in namespace `test` using image `busybox`.
Ensure it has a label `tier=frontend`.


# Task 2: Expose Service
Expose the deployment `resource-33ks95-dep` as a Service named `resource-33ks95` in namespace `prod`.
The service should listen on port `7488` and be of type `NodePort`.


# Task 3: Create a Pod
Create a pod named `resource-5vvw1u` in namespace `test` using image `python:3.9`.
Ensure it has a label `release=stable`.


# Task 4: Persistent Volume Claim
Create a PersistentVolumeClaim named `resource-url3i2` in namespace `staging`.
Request `10Gi` storage with access mode `ReadWriteMany`.


# Task 5: Expose Service
Expose the deployment `resource-bt25ha-dep` as a Service named `resource-bt25ha` in namespace `dev`.
The service should listen on port `8631` and be of type `ClusterIP`.


# Task 6: Scale Deployment
Create a deployment named `resource-6c565y` in namespace `backend` using image `mysql`.
Scale it to `2` replicas.
Then, perform a rolling update to image `mysql:latest`.


# Task 7: Node Maintenance
Mark node `node-3` as unschedulable (cordon).
Then drain the node, ignoring daemonsets.
Finally, uncordon the node.


# Task 8: Scale Deployment
Create a deployment named `resource-buyb6x` in namespace `frontend` using image `node:14`.
Scale it to `3` replicas.
Then, perform a rolling update to image `node:14:latest`.


# Task 9: Persistent Volume Claim
Create a PersistentVolumeClaim named `resource-y67o73` in namespace `default`.
Request `5Gi` storage with access mode `ReadOnlyMany`.


# Task 10: Expose Service

# Task 17: Node Maintenance
Mark node `node-3` as unschedulable (cordon).
Then drain the node, ignoring daemonsets.
Finally, uncordon the node.


# Task 18: Node Maintenance
Mark node `node-2` as unschedulable (cordon).
Then drain the node, ignoring daemonsets.
Finally, uncordon the node.


# Task 19: Node Maintenance
Mark node `node-4` as unschedulable (cordon).
Then drain the node, ignoring daemonsets.
Finally, uncordon the node.
