# Cluster Bootstrap: Kubeadm

Understanding how the cluster comes alive.

# Task 1: Check Kubelet Status
Verify that the kubelet service is active on the node.

```bash
systemctl status kubelet | grep Active
```

```setup
echo "Ready"
```

```verify
systemctl is-active kubelet > /dev/null
```

## CNI Installation
The cluster is **NotReady** until a CNI (Network Plugin) is installed.
- The CNI binaires go to \`/opt/cni/bin\`.
- The config goes to \`/etc/cni/net.d\`.
