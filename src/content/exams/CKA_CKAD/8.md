# Scheduling

Controlling where Pods go.

## Taints & Tolerations
"Repel" pods from nodes.
- Master nodes are tainted \`NoSchedule\`.

# Task 1: Check Node Taints
Inspect the taints on the controlplane node (if accessible).

```bash
kubectl describe node | grep Taint
```

```setup
echo "Ready"
```

```verify
kubectl get nodes > /dev/null
```

## Affinity
"Attract" pods to nodes.
- \`nodeAffinity\`: Run on nodes with SSD.
