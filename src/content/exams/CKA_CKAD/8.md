# Scheduling

Controlling where Pods go.

## Taints & Tolerations
"Repel" pods from nodes.
- Master nodes are tainted \`NoSchedule\`.

\`\`\`bash
# View taints on nodes
kubectl describe node controlplane | grep Taint
\`\`\`

## Affinity
"Attract" pods to nodes.
- \`nodeAffinity\`: Run on nodes with SSD.
