# Troubleshooting & Logs

When things go wrong, here is how to find out why.

## Basic Commands
- \`kubectl describe\`: Detailed information about a resource.
- \`kubectl logs\`: Print the logs for a container in a pod.

## Common Pod States
- **Pending**: Scheduler can't find a node (CPU/RAM insufficient, Taints).
- **CrashLoopBackOff**: Application is starting and immediately failing. Check logs!
- **ImagePullBackOff**: Can't pull image (Auth, Typo, Network).

## Debugging Services
Service not working? Check the **Endpoints**.
\`\`\`bash
# Does the service have endpoints?
kubectl get endpoints my-svc
\`\`\`

\`\`\`bash
# Describe a failing pod
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>

# Check logs for a specific pod (and previous instance if crashed)
kubectl logs <pod-name> --previous
\`\`\`
