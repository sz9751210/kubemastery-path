# Troubleshooting & Logs

When things go wrong, here is how to find out why.

## Basic Commands
- \`kubectl describe\`: Detailed information about a resource.
- \`kubectl logs\`: Print the logs for a container in a pod.

## Common Pod States
- **Pending**: Scheduler can't find a node (CPU/RAM insufficient, Taints).
- **CrashLoopBackOff**: Application is starting and immediately failing. Check logs!
- **ImagePullBackOff**: Can't pull image (Auth, Typo, Network).

## Debugging Services
Service not working? Check the **Endpoints**.
# Task 1: Check Endpoints
Verify that the `kubernetes` service has endpoints.

```bash
kubectl get endpoints kubernetes
```

```setup
echo "Ready"
```

```verify
kubectl get endpoints kubernetes > /dev/null
```
