# Workloads: Deployments & ReplicaSets

Pods are ephemeral. **Deployments** provide declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets.

## The Hierarchy
\`Deployment\` manages \`ReplicaSet\` manages \`Pod\`.

# Task 1: Create Deployment
Create a deployment `my-dep` with 3 replicas of `nginx`.

```bash
kubectl create deployment my-dep --image=nginx --replicas=3
```

```setup
kubectl delete deployment my-dep 2>/dev/null || true
```

```verify
kubectl get deployment my-dep -o jsonpath='{.spec.replicas}' | grep 3
```

## Features
- **Self-healing**: Restarts crashed pods.
- **Scaling**: 
\`\`\`bash
kubectl scale deployment my-dep --replicas=5
\`\`\`
