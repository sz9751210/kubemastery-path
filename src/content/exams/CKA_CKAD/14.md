# Control Plane & API Server

The brains of the cluster.

## Components
- **kube-apiserver**: The gateway for all REST commands.
- **etcd**: Consistent and highly-available key value store.
- **kube-scheduler**: Watches for newly created Pods with no assigned node.
- **kube-controller-manager**: Runs controller processes.

\`\`\`bash
# Check the status of control plane components
kubectl get pods -n kube-system -l tier=control-plane
\`\`\`
