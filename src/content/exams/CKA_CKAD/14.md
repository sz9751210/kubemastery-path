# Control Plane & API Server

The brains of the cluster.

## Components
- **kube-apiserver**: The gateway for all REST commands.
- **etcd**: Consistent and highly-available key value store.
- **kube-scheduler**: Watches for newly created Pods with no assigned node.
- **kube-controller-manager**: Runs controller processes.

# Task 1: Check Control Plane
Verify that the control plane components are running in `kube-system`.

```bash
kubectl get pods -n kube-system -l tier=control-plane
```

```setup
echo "Ready"
```

```verify
kubectl get pods -n kube-system -l tier=control-plane > /dev/null
```
