# Cluster Architecture

Understand the machine you are driving.

## The Two Planes
1.  **Control Plane** (The Brain):
    -   Manages the state of the cluster.
    -   Components: API Server, Etcd, Scheduler, Controller Manager.
2.  **Data Plane** (The Muscle):
    -   Runs the workloads.
    -   Components: Kubelet, Kube-Proxy, Container Runtime.

## Kubelet
The agent that runs on every node. It registers the node with the apiserver and ensures Pods are running and healthy.

# Task 1: Inspect Nodes
List all nodes with detailed information.

```bash
kubectl get nodes -o wide
```

```setup
echo "Ready"
```

```verify
kubectl get nodes > /dev/null
```
