# Service Implementation: Deep Dive

How does a Service IP (ClusterIP) actually work? It's virtual! It doesn't exist on any interface.

## kube-proxy
The component responsible for watching the API Server for Services/Endpoints and configuring rules.

## Iptables Mode (Default)
Traffic is captured by PREROUTING/OUTPUT chains and redirected.
- **Chain KUBE-SERVICES**: The entry point.
- **Chain KUBE-SVC-***: Round-robin load balancing (using statistic mode random probability).
- **Chain KUBE-SEP-***: Service EndPoint (DNAT to actual Pod IP).

\`\`\`bash
# View service rules
sudo iptables -t nat -L KUBE-SERVICES
\`\`\`

## IPVS Mode
Uses Linux Kernel's IP Virtual Server (Netfilter).
- **Performance**: O(1) matching vs O(n) for iptables (sequential scan).
- **Scalability**: Better for thousands of services.
