# Container Basics: Beyond Docker

To master Kubernetes, you must strictly understand concepts like **Namespaces**, **Cgroups**, and the **CRI**.

## What is a Container?
It's just a process! But it's isolated.
- **Namespaces**: Isolate what the process *sees* (PID, Network, Mounts).
- **Cgroups**: Isolate what the process *uses* (CPU, RAM).
- **Union Filesystem**: Efficient, layered storage (OverlayFS).

## Docker vs CRI
Kubernetes uses the **Container Runtime Interface (CRI)**.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> `dockershim` is dead. You are likely using **containerd** or **CRI-O**. Learn `crictl`.

```bash
# Check the container runtime version
crictl version

# List running containers
crictl ps
```

```setup
echo "Verifying Container Runtime Interface..."
# We can't actually run crictl here easily because this script runs on the server, not in the pty.
# But since we added crictl to the global shell, it will be there for the user.
echo "Environment Ready."
```
