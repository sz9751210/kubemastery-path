# Multi-Container Pods

Sharing is caring. Sometimes one container isn't enough.

## Patterns
1.  **Sidecar**: Helper container (e.g., Log shipper, Proxy).
2.  **Adapter**: Standardizes output (e.g., Metrics converter).
3.  **Ambassador**: Proxies connection to outside world.

## Shared Resources
Containers in a Pod share:
-   **Network Namespace**: Same IP, same localhost.
-   **Volumes**: Shared filesystems.

    image: busybox
    command: ["sh", "-c", "tail -f /var/log/nginx/access.log"]
    volumeMounts:
    - name: shared-logs
