# ReplicaSets & Deployments

Ensuring your application is always running and easily updated.

## ReplicaSet
The primary goal of a **ReplicaSet** is to maintain a stable set of replica Pods running at any given time.

\`\`\`bash
# Look at the replicasets in your cluster
kubectl get rs
\`\`\`

## Deployment
**Deployments** allow you to manage the rollout of new versions of your application.

\`\`\`bash
# Create a deployment with 3 replicas
kubectl create deployment web-server --image=nginx --replicas=3

# Update the image
kubectl set image deployment/web-server nginx=nginx:1.16.1
\`\`\`
