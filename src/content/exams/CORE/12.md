# ReplicaSets & Deployments

Ensuring your application is always running and easily updated.

## ReplicaSet
The primary goal of a **ReplicaSet** is to maintain a stable set of replica Pods running at any given time.

# Task 1: Inspect ReplicaSets
List the replicasets in the current namespace.

```bash
kubectl get rs
```

```setup
echo "Ready"
```

```verify
kubectl get rs --no-headers > /dev/null 2>&1 || exit 0
```

## Deployment
**Deployments** allow you to manage the rollout of new versions of your application.

# Task 2: Create a Deployment
Create a deployment with 3 replicas and update its image.

```bash
kubectl create deployment web-server --image=nginx --replicas=3
kubectl set image deployment/web-server nginx=nginx:1.16.1
```

```setup
# Clean up if exists
kubectl delete deploy web-server 2>/dev/null || true
```

```verify
kubectl get deploy web-server -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.containers[0].image}' | grep "nginx:1.16.1"
kubectl get deploy web-server -o jsonpath='{.spec.replicas}' | grep 3
```
