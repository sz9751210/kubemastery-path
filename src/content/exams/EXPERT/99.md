# Chaos Challenge: The Broken Cluster

> [!WARNING]
> This is a **live fire** exercise. We have deliberately broken this cluster.

## Scenario
You are the on-call Site Reliability Engineer. Minutes ago, all \`kubectl\` commands started failing.

# Task 1: Fix the Broken Cluster
The API server is down. Find out why and fix it!

```bash
# Hint: Check /etc/kubernetes/manifests
```

```setup
# BREAK THE CLUSTER: Move the kube-apiserver manifest
sudo mv /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml /etc/kubernetes/kube-apiserver.yaml.broken
```

```verify
# The fix is to move it back
kubectl get nodes --no-headers | grep Ready
```
