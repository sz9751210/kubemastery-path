> This is a **live fire** exercise. We have deliberately broken this cluster.

## Scenario
You are the on-call Site Reliability Engineer. Minutes ago, all \`kubectl\` commands started failing.

## Your Mission
1.  **Diagnose** why the API Server is failing.
2.  **Fix** the underlying issue.
3.  **Restore** cluster connectivity.
