# Operators & Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)

Extending the Kubernetes API.

## CRD (Custom Resource Definition)
Allows you to define your own API resources.

\`\`\`bash
# List custom resources
kubectl get crd
\`\`\`

## The Operator Pattern
An Operator is a Controller that watches a CRD and acts on it.
