# Operators & Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)

Extending the Kubernetes API.

## CRD (Custom Resource Definition)
Allows you to define your own API resources.

# Task 1: List CRDs
Verify that the cluster supports Custom Resource Definitions.

```bash
kubectl get crd
```

```setup
echo "Ready"
```

```verify
kubectl get crd > /dev/null
```

## The Operator Pattern
An Operator is a Controller that watches a CRD and acts on it.
