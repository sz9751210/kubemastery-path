# Helm: Kubernetes Package Manager

Managing thousands of YAML files is painful. **Helm** solves this using **Charts**.

## Concepts
- **Chart**: A bundle of information necessary to create an instance of a Kubernetes application.
- **Release**: A running instance of a chart.

# Task 1: Check Helm Releases
List all Helm releases across all namespaces.

```bash
helm list -A
```

```setup
# Ensure helm is installed
helm version > /dev/null 2>&1 || (echo "Helm not found" && exit 1)
```

```verify
helm version > /dev/null
```
