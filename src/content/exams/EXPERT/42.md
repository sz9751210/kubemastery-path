# Service Mesh

Managing network traffic between services (East-West traffic).

## Why use a Mesh?
1. **Observability**: Tracing, Metrics.
2. **Traffic Control**: Canary types.
3. **Security**: mTLS.

# Task 1: Check for Sidecars
Look for workloads that have Istio sidecar injection enabled.

```bash
kubectl get pods -A -l istio-injection=enabled
```

```setup
echo "Ready"
```

```verify
kubectl get pods -A > /dev/null
```
