# Advanced Deployment Strategies

## Blue/Green Deployment
- Two identical environments.
- **Switch**: Update the Service selector to point to the new version.
- **Pros**: Instant rollback. **Cons**: Double resources.

## Canary Deployment
- Roll out to a small subset of users.
- **Implementation**: Two Deployments (Stable & Canary) with common labels targeted by one Service.
- **Traffic Splitting**: Use Ingress or Service Mesh for % based splitting.

## Rolling Update
- Default strategy.
- **Parameters**: \`maxSurge\` (how many extra) and \`maxUnavailable\` (how many down).
