# Application Build & Images

## Dockerfile Best Practices
- **Multi-stage builds**: Keep the final image small by separating build and runtime environments.
- **User Permissions**: Never run as root. Use \`USER\`.
- **Layers**: Combine commands to reduce layers.

\`\`\`dockerfile
# Multi-stage example
FROM golang:1.21 as builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN go build -o myapp

FROM alpine:latest
WORKDIR /root/
COPY --from=builder /app/myapp .
CMD ["./myapp"]
\`\`\`
