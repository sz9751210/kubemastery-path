# Application Build & Images

## Dockerfile Best Practices
- **Multi-stage builds**: Keep the final image small by separating build and runtime environments.
- **User Permissions**: Never run as root. Use \`USER\`.
- **Layers**: Combine commands to reduce layers.

# Task 1: Check Images
Verify that `crictl` is using the correct endpoint for images.

```bash
crictl images
```

```setup
echo "Ready"
```

```verify
crictl images > /dev/null
```
